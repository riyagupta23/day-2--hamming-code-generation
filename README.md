# day-2--hamming-code-generation
Hamming code is used for error correction and error detection in digital. I have generated 7 bit hamming code. It has 4 bit data which is appended by 3 bit parity bits to ensure the correction and detection of the error bits. 
For simulation, I use ModelSim  and for synthesis I use Quartus Prime
